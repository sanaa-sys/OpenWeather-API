Our test strategy involves Statement Coverage which is a part of white-box testing.
Our code is divided into multiple functions with each function processing a particular argument.
It is statement coverage as our test cases test almost each function using unit testing along with the mock module.
To ensure maximum statement coverage we have selected our test cases with the following method-

It is centred on 4 cities:London,Melbourne,Tokyo and California
We have chosen these 4 cities as they have different time zones which will be useful for testing the time argument.
Also it will be useful to test the 4 different ways of inputting the location.
The city argument has been tested with London, the city id argument has been tested with Tokyo, the latitude and longitude argument has 
been with California and the zip code argument has been tested with Melbourne. 
To test the temperature argument,the temperature for London  will be shown in fahrenheit and that for California it will be in celsius.
The sunrise and sunset arguments will be tested with Melbourne and California as these both cities are on different sides on of the UTC.
To test the wind speed arguments,the wind speed for London will be shown in m/s and that for California it will be in km/hr.
To test the other optional arguments, any 2 random cities have been chosen as there are no specific requirements for their usage.

To see the coverage of our test cases we are accessing data from Gitlab-Runner.

Currently we have 80% statement coverage with 36 out of 179 statements being missed. 
Limitations-
We did not test the help argument in our test cases.
We did not display an error message when the user inputs the same argument multiple times.
